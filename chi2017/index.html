<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
<p>
  Personal Informatics and the Quantified Self, or tracking oneâ€™s self to gain self-knowledge,have grown in interest both in research and commercially.
  People often use digital tools to track themselves, from wearables such as Fitbit and the Apple Watch to phone apps such as Mint and SleepCycle.
  This workshop explores how researchers can shape the future of the field.
</p>
<p>
  The workshop has three objectives:
  <ol>
    <li>Outlining a research agenda for personal informatics</li>
    <li>Defining lessons learned from running and reporting on studies of personal informatics tools</li>
    <li>Developing a list of key skills which a new student in personal informatics should know</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Interested researchers and practitioners are encouraged to submit 2-6 pages in CHI extended abstract format related to one of the three topics:
  <ol>
    <li>A research vision or provocation about future work</li>
    <li>A description of lessons learned from a particularly effective or challenging study of personal informatics tools</li>
    <li>A used or potential syllabus or account of teaching or taking a course in personal informatics</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:pi_chi2017@uw.edu">pi_chi2017@uw.edu</a> with the subject line "Workshop Submission".
</p>
<p>
  Note: one author of each accepted submission must register for the workshop and at least one day of the conference.
